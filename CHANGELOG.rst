  Increase safe obstacle distance to 1.5m
* Increase safe obstacle distance to 1.5m
  Safe obstacle distance is calculated from the center of the drone. This
  is important to keep in mind when setting safe obstacle distance.

  Trigger builds only when repository is updated. Use git sha as build id
  for Artifactory builds.
* Merge pull request `#6 <https://github.com/tiiuae/navigation/issues/6>`_ from tiiuae/smaller_obstacle_safe_distance
